//! Cache-friendly arena allocation for stack graph data.
//!
//! A stack graph is composed of instances of many different data types, and to store the graph
//! structure itself, we need cyclic or self-referential data types.  The typical way to achieve
//! this in Rust is to use [arena allocation][], where all of the instances of a particular type
//! are stored in a single vector.  You then use indexes into this vector to store references to a
//! data instance.  Because indexes are just numbers, you don't run afoul of borrow checker.  And
//! because all instances live together in a continguous region of memory, your data access
//! patterns are very cache-friendly.
//!
//! This module implements a simple arena allocation scheme for stack graphs.  An
//! [`Arena<T>`][`Arena`] is an arena that holds all of the instances of type `T` for a stack
//! graph.  A [`Handle<T>`][`Handle`] holds the index of a particular instance of `T` in its arena.
//! All of our stack graph data types then use handles to refer to other parts of the stack graph.
//!
//! Note that our arena implementation does not support deletion!  Any content that you add to a
//! [`StackGraph`][] will live as long as the stack graph itself does.  The entire region of memory
//! for each arena will be freed in a single operation when the stack graph is dropped.
//!

/// type to index into an arena of another type.  However, if you have multiple arenas for the
/// _same type_, we do not do anything to ensure that you only use a handle with the corresponding
