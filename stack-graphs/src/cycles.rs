//! Detect and avoid cycles in our path-finding algorithm.
//!
//! Cycles in a stack graph can indicate many things.  Your language might allow mutually recursive
//! imports.  If you are modeling dataflow through function calls, then any recursion in your
//! function calls will lead to cycles in your stack graph.  And if you have any control-flow paths
//! that lead to infinite loops at runtime, we'll probably discover those as stack graph paths
//! during the path-finding algorithm.
//!
//! (Note that we're only considering cycles in well-formed paths.  For instance, _pop symbol_
//! nodes are "guards" that don't allow you to progress into a node if the top of the symbol stack
//! doesn't match.  We don't consider that a valid path, and so we don't have to worry about
//! whether it contains any cycles.)
//!
//! This module implements a cycle detector that lets us detect these situations and "cut off"
//! these paths, not trying to extend them any further.  Note that any cycle detection logic we
//! implement will be a heuristic.  In particular, since our path-finding algorithm will mimic any
//! runtime recursion, a "complete" cycle detection logic would be equivalent to the Halting
//! Problem.
//!
//! Right now, we implement a simple heuristic where we limit the number of distinct paths that we
//! process that have the same start and end nodes.  We do not make any guarantees that we will
//! always use this particular heuristic, however!  We reserve the right to change the heuristic at
//! any time.
